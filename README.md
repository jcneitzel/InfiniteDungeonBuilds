# InfiniteDungeonBuilds
Location for test builds of The Infinite Dungeon roguelike dungeon crawler game.

The Infinite Dungeon is a brutal, endless dungeon crawl that combines the tactical adventuring party flavor of classic fantasy tabletop games with a fast-paced roguelike structure.

Latest builds will be put up here for test distribution. Simply download the latest zip, extract, and run the contained .exe.

Feedback is always appreciated, but current focus is on gameplay experience and content so feedback there first and foremost would be appreciated. I am aware that aesthetics and UI quality have a long ways to go.
